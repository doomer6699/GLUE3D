Glue3D is a full game engine built ENTIRELY in vanilla scratch. It uses the pen extension only. It's an ambitious project I've been 
working on to prove what's possible on scratch, while helping others learn more about 3D in an easy way. Everything on how to use the
project is provided in the documentation below. Glue3D is a project programmed completely by me. The layout, the mechanics, 
everything was done by me. However, I'd like to thank many people:
-Llwyd (@dnduality), for making all the models in this engine. He provided all the models in the OBJ format, and optimized them for glue3D.
-@GarnetonScratch, For the 3D cat model (optimized by Llwyd for glue3d.)
-The icons are MacOS X icons (some are made by me).
-The sounds are combinations of windows XP, Longhorn, 7 and PS2.
-And finally, a simple thank you to these people:
