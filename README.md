# Glue3D

**Glue3D** is a full game engine built *entirely* within the vanilla scratch programming language, uusing the pen extension only. It has many features, such as **textured rendering**, **model editing**, **bone keyframe animations**, **scripting**, **file management**, as well as **exporting a final build** of your game. 

It's an ambitious project I've been working on to prove what's possible on scratch, while helping others learn more about 3D in an easy way. Glue3D is a project programmed completely by me including the layout, the mechanics, and everything else.

## Getting Started

The only thing you need to begin using Glue3D is the .sb3 file provided in this repository. Simply download it by selecting "Code" and "Download ZIP", or if you have git installed, you can use the following

```
git clone https://github.com/GL00B/GLUE3D.git
```

Now that you have your copy, it's time to read the documentation :).

## Documentation

> [!CAUTION]
> It is super important to read the documentation. Beta tests have shown that people are truly clueless without it. If you plan to actually make something with this engine, you should really read this, even if just briefly.

All documentation is available at https://gl00b.github.io/GLUE3D/ 


## Thanks

I'd like to thank many people:
- Llwyd (**@dnduality**), for making all the models in this engine. He provided all the models in the OBJ format, and optimized them for glue3D.
- **@GarnetonScratch**, For the 3D cat model (optimized by **Llwyd** for Glue3D.)
- The icons are MacOS X icons (some are made by me).
- The sounds are combinations of windows XP, Longhorn, 7 and PS2.
- And finally, a simple thank you to these people:
